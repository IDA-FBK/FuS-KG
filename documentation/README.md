### Datasets

The datasets folder provides information about the multi-modal data sources used inside FuS-KG (i.e., [Recipe1M+](https://im2recipe.csail.mit.edu/) and [Tasty Video Dataset](https://cvml.comp.nus.edu.sg/tasty/index.html)).

### Diagrams

The diagrams folder contains visual representations of the modules of FuS-KG and a corresponding [README.md](https://github.com/IDA-FBK/FuS-KG/blob/main/diagrams/README.md) explaining each module.

### Example

The example folder includes two Turtle files:

1. [fuskg-user-example.ttl](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/IDA-FBK/FuS-KG/refs/heads/main/example/fuskg-user-example.ttl) Modeling user health data in FuS-KG for health monitoring, analysis, and recommendations.
2. [fuskg-notcooking-example.ttl](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/IDA-FBK/FuS-KG/refs/heads/main/example/fuskg-notcooking-example.ttl) Representing a sequence of steps required to complete an activity (non-cooking domain) with multimodal resources for instructional applications.

### Notebook

The Notebook folder contains a Python Colab Notebook showing how to interact with FuS-KG modules by performing SPARQL queries based on the CQs of each REQ together with a [README.md](https://github.com/IDA-FBK/FuS-KG/blob/main/notebook/README.md)
to guide you through the process of loading and running the notebook.

### Ontology

The ontology folder contains the [TBox](https://github.com/IDA-FBK/FuS-KG/tree/main/ontology/TBox) and [ABox](https://github.com/IDA-FBK/FuS-KG/tree/main/ontology/ABox) files of FuS-KG.

### Requirements and Competency Questions

The requirements folder contains the set of high-level requirements and competency questions derived from the research questions that guided the building of FuS-KG.
